# Jow API

This is a Python package that allows you to search for recipes on [Jow.fr](https://Jow.fr). The package provides an easy-to-use interface to search for recipes and fetch information about them.

## Installation

You can install the package using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) : 

```bash
pip install jow-api
```

## Usage
The package provides convenient functions for searching and obtaining recipe information. Here's an example:

```python
from src.jow_api import Jow

# Perform a search for recipes containing the word "poulet"
recipes = Jow.search("poulet", limit=5)

# Loop through each recipe in the results and print its attributes
for recipe in recipes:
    print(f"ID: {recipe.id}")
    print(f"Name: {recipe.name}")
    print(f"URL: {recipe.url}")
    print(f"Description: {recipe.description}")
    print(f"Preparation time: {recipe.preparationTime}")
    print(f"Cooking time: {recipe.cookingTime}")
    print(f"Preparation extra time per cover: {recipe.preparationExtraTimePerCover}")
    print(f"Covers count: {recipe.coversCount}")
    print("Ingredients:")
    for ingredient in recipe.ingredients:
        print(f"\t{ingredient.name}: {ingredient.quantity} {ingredient.unit}")
        if ingredient.isOptional:
            print("\t(optional)")
    print()

```
The Jow.search() function takes a search query as input, with an optional limit parameter, and returns a list of JowResult objects. Each JowResult object contains information about a single recipe, including its ID, name, URL on Jow.fr, and a list of ingredients.

Each JowResult object contains the following attributes:

- `id` : The ID of the recipe.
- `name` : The name of the recipe.

- `ingredients` : A list of Ingredient objects, each of which represents an ingredient used in the recipe.
- `imageUrl` : The URL of the recipe image on Jow.fr.
- `videoUrl` : The URL of the recipe video on Jow.fr.
- `description` : A short description of the recipe.
- `preparationTime` : The time required to prepare the recipe (in minutes).
- `preparationExtraTimePerCover` : The extra time required to prepare the recipe for each additional serving.
- `cookingTime` : The time required to cook the recipe (in minutes).

Each Ingredient object contains the following attributes:

- `name` : The name of the ingredient.
- `quantity` : The quantity of the ingredient needed for the recipe.
- `unit` : The unit of measurement for the quantity of the ingredient.
